##The Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor is a web-based application that allows multiple users to edit documents simultaneously. It ensures real-time synchronization of content, enabling seamless

collaboration. The project leverages React.js for the frontend, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface, while the backend is built using Node.js and Express.js with Socket.IO for WebSocket communication. 

The documents are stored in MongoDB, ensuring persistent data managementWhen a user opens a document, they join a unique document session where changes are instantly reflected across all connected users. React-

Quill, a rich text editor, is used for editing, offering a smooth and user-friendly experience. The backend manages WebSocket connections, broadcasting updates in real-time. Users can edit the document 

collaboratively, and upon saving, changes are stored in the database for future access.This editor is ideal for teams, students, and professionals needing a shared workspace for writing and editing. It can be 

expanded with user authentication, version history, and access control for enhanced functionality. By integrating PostgreSQL or MongoDB, the system ensures efficient and scalable data handling. This project 

demonstrates real-time communication, database integration, and responsive UI development in a modern web application##
